This folder contains an implementation of peak and reachable set estimation
with polytopic uncertainty/input. The uncertainty is decomposed using the 
faces of the polytope using convex duality and a theory of alternatives.
This Alternative method contrasts with switching between each corner of the
polytope, where the number of corners may rise exponentially in dimension.
